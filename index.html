    <div class="vulnerability">
        <h2>1. MV2 Depreciation Vulnerability</h2>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The MV2 Depreciation Vulnerability is a vulnerability discovered by deacon. (codename=bishop) It exploits a vulnerability in which if a organization managed extension is below Version 3, the chrome system will disable it with admin privilages.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Impact:</strong>This exploit, depending on your district, can completely delete the lightspeed classroom and filter agent. allowing you to visit any website of your choice. and removing teachers access to your screen. </p>
        
        <p><strong>Steps to Execute: </strong></p>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Open <code>chrome://flags</code>. If it's blocked, you're screwed.</li>
            <li>Search "extension manifest".</li>
            <li>You should see these three flags. Set them as I've typed:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extension Manifest V2 Deprecation Warning Stage</strong>: Enabled</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension Manifest V2 Deprecation Disabled Stage</strong>: Enabled</li>
                    <li><strong>Changes accessibility features from extension manifest v2 to v3</strong>: Default</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Restart your Chromebook. And if your Lightspeed wasn't updated, it should be disabled. Some people still have classroom (what allows teachers to see your screen) and some don't. It depends on your district.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>thats all for now</p>
